# This is a factor applied to all disk limits to create a "soft" limit
# for disk usage. The "hard" limit is applied when a test is requested.
# If the estimated filesize of the test would put the "user class" over
# the "disk" quota, then the test is denied. However, it is possible due
# to "duplicate" packets that a test session file may end up larger than
# this estimate. If that happens, and if the file is successfully saved to
# disk - upon completion of the test, actual filesize is used to update the
# disk usage in the resource broker process. At this point the "soft" limit
# is applied - if the filesize causes the "user class" to go over the
# "soft" quota (disk number multiplied by diskfudge) then the file is
# immediately deleted. (I recommend a liberal factor here because if you get
# lots of duplicates and need to apply a "soft" limit - the data will probably
# be quite interesting. However, it is useful to have this factor so disk
# usage is not as vulnerable to replay dos attacks of the test protocol.)
